## **Projects**  

### **FINANCIAL ANALYSIS (Series01-DA_Financial)**  
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis applied to a financial dataset. The goal is to identify patterns, relationships, and insights that can assist in decision-making in financial contexts such as risk management, fraud detection, and financial behavior prediction.  

#### **Analysis Objectives:**  

- Assess potential issues in the dataset.  
- Evaluate financial flows to identify patterns in payments and receipts and assess the company's financial stability.  
- Identify geographic patterns in customer and supplier behavior to optimize market strategies.  
- Analyze the temporal behavior of transactions to detect seasonality and trends.  
- Build a Power BI dashboard for data visualization based on these themes.  

#### **Technologies Used:**  

- Python: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.  
- Jupyter Notebook.  
- Power BI for advanced visualization.  
- Git and GitHub for version control.

### **EDA UTILIS**  
The "EDA Utilis" project is a reusable and scalable Python module designed to simplify the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process across various domains. This toolkit facilitates tasks such as data loading, cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis, making the initial phases of any data science project more efficient and structured.  

#### **Features:**  

- Data loading and preprocessing.  
- Generation of descriptive statistics.  
- Graphical visualizations for pattern and outlier identification.  
- Handling of missing values and inconsistent data.  

#### **Technologies Used:**  

- Python: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.  
- Jupyter Notebook.  
- Git and GitHub for version control.
